# 7MinutesWorkout


This is a 7 Minute Workout app designed for Android devices. The app follows a specific workout routine that alternates between 10 seconds of rest and 30 seconds of exercise. During the rest intervals, the app displays the upcoming exercise to prepare the user for what's next.

To enhance the user experience, the app incorporates Text-to-Speech functionality, which allows the exercises to be spoken aloud. This feature provides auditory guidance to the user, making it easier to follow along with the workout routine.

To help users track their progress, the app includes a progress bar. This visual indicator allows users to monitor their advancement throughout the workout session, providing a sense of accomplishment and motivation.

To signal the end of each rest or exercise interval, the app notifies the user with a bell sound. This audio cue helps the user stay on track and transition smoothly between the rest and exercise periods.

In addition to the workout features, the app also offers a BMI calculator functionality. By inputting their height and weight, users can calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). This feature provides users with a convenient tool to assess their body composition and monitor their fitness goals.

To optimize efficiency and reduce code complexity, the app utilizes a RecyclerView. This component enables the creation of dynamic and reusable views, making it easier to manage the display of exercises and resulting in more efficient code implementation.
